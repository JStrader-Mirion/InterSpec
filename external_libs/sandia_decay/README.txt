SandiaDecay: library that provides nuclear decay informations and calculations.

Requires rapidxml (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/) and a c++ compiler to compile.

Source data in sandia.decay.xml is originally based on ENSDF data, with 
corrections based on observed gamma spectroscopy data.  X-ray information
obtained from the ToRI x-ray database.
