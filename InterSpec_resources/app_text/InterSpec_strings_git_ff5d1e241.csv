        The normal background subtraction option only affects display of the data, with operations
        like peak-fitting or exporting data are done on the full-statistics original foreground
        spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        A ""hard background subtraction"" creates a modified foreground by doing a bin-by-bin
        subtraction of the background from the foreground.
      </p>

      Side effects of doing a hard background subtraction include:
      <ul style=""list-style-type: square; margin-top: 4px;"">
        <li>Variances, i.e. the statistical uncertainty of each channel, will no longer be correct.</li>
        <li>Small energy calibration differences between spectra may create artificial features in the data.</li>
        <li>
          If a peak in the foreground overlaps with a peak in the background, the statistical uncertainty of fit foreground peaks will no longer be correct
        </li>
      </ul>

      The primary reasons to choose a hard background subtraction over normal display background subtraction are:
      <ul style=""list-style-type: square; margin-top: 4px;"">
        <li>Avoiding artifacts on fit peak continuums.</li>
        <li>To simplify background peak subtraction in the <b>Activity/Shielding Fit</b> tool.</li>

    An additional uncertainty to add to the relative efficiency line, for each fit photopeak.
    <br />
    Small deviations in efficiency of detection for one or a few high statistics peaks can cause the
    efficiency curve to notably deviate from the other points if only statical uncertainties are
    used; when an additional uncertainty is added the relative efficiency will then do a better job
    of visibly going through all the data points, and from limited testing produce more accurate
    results.  You can think of this as adding a systematic uncertainty to each detected photopeak,
    that is uncorrelated between peaks.  From limited testing the value used is not hugely
    important, just as long as there is something.  You can also choose to use an unweighted fit,
    where each peak will contribute to the fit equally, no matter its statistical uncertainty.
