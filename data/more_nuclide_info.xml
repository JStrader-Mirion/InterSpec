      <Notes>
Uses: density-thickness gauges, static eliminators, lightning preventers, industrial neutron sources (with beryllium, lithium, or other light nuclei), smoke detectors,
Osteoporosis detection, heart imaging, fill height detectors, measuring ash content of coal, oil and gas exploration, various industrial processes, and moisture gauges.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check for the presence of Np-237/Pa-233.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be found with Am-243 (7.4 ky) / Np-239 (2.4 d).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider Am-241:Be, Am-241:Li&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For Am-241 neutron sources, check for peaks from (n,γ) and (n,n'γ) neutron reactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Am-241 Neutron Source Info:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Am-241:Be - Check for a Doppler broadened peak at 4438.9 keV from Be-9(α,n)C-12. 
      If the 4438.9 keV peak is very weakly present or difficult to ID, consider double binning the data.&lt;br/&gt;
      Check for Mn-56 (2.6 h) from neutron activation of minor/trace amounts of Mn in alloys.  
      Due to interference, Mn-56 can be hard to confirm when strong Fe(n,n') emissions are also present.&lt;br/&gt;
      Average neutron energy = 4.5 MeV.&lt;br/&gt;
      Yield = 2.2E+06 n/s per Ci.&lt;br/&gt;
      Gammas per source neutron ≈ 0.557.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Am-241:Li - Check for a Doppler broadened “triangular” peak at 477.6 keV from Li-7(α,α')Li-7.&lt;br/&gt;
    Check for Eu-154 (8.6 y) + Eu-152 (13.5 y) from neutron activation of minor/trace amounts of Eu in alloys. &lt;br/&gt;
    Average neutron energy = 0.54 MeV.&lt;br/&gt;
    Yield = 6.0E+04 n/s per Ci.&lt;br/&gt;
    Gammas per source neutron ≈ 21.1.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check for Doppler broadened “square” peak at 477.6 keV from B-10(n,α)Li-7.&lt;br/&gt;
    If present with H-1(n,γ) peak at 2223.3 keV, consider presence of borated polyethylene (an effective and common neutron shield).  &lt;br/&gt;
    Note: Borosilicate glass is the most commonly used window material used in photomultiplier tubes [HAMAMATSU].
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If a portable Am-241:Be nuclear gauge is suspected, check for Cs-137. 
A typical portable nuclear gauge source initially contains 8 mCi of Cs-137 (30.2 y) 
and 40 mCi (8.80E+04 n/sec) of Am-241:Be (432.2 y) or 60 µCi (2.64E+05 n/sec) of Cf-252 (2.6 y).

Treatment may involve significant radioactivity (e.g. 4.4 GBq is quoted as an average dose of I-131 for thyroid ablation, and up to 11 GBq for patients with advanced metastatic disease). According to US regulatory guidelines for I-131, the patient can be released if the activity is below 1.2 GBq, or 0.07 mSv/hr at 1 metre. Meanwhile a lot of I-131 is flushed down the hospital toilet and plumbing needs to be shielded accordingly [GNRIM].

"Iodine-131 (half-life of 8 days) is a reactor-produced radioisotope used for the treatment of cancer (in particular thyroid cancer) and other thyroid diseases. Individual doses range from 0.5 millicurie (adrenal gland tumors) to 4–10 millicuries (hyperthyroidism) to 100–200 millicuries (thyroid cancer therapy). The isotope is transported in vials or capsules with activities of 1–100 millicuries each. In addition to injection, an encapsulated liquid formulation may also be administered to patients.  Bulk quantities of iodine-131 are transported and stored within protective lead containers and can impart high radiation doses if removed. Its gamma-ray energies will trigger surveillance radiation alarms."  Worldwide Illicit Trafficking of Nuclear and Radiological Materials, May 2024, LLNL-MI-866270.

Production mode: Usually produced by neutron activation of natural or enriched lutetium-176 targets or indirectly by neutron irradiation of Yb-176.  The ytterbium production route does not produce the Lu-177m impurity.

"Lu-177 is increasingly important as it emits just enough gamma for imaging while the beta radiation does the therapy on small (e.g. endocrine) tumors. Its half-life is long enough to allow sophisticated preparation for use.  It is usually produced by neutron activation of natural or enriched lutetium-176 targets."-[GNRIM]

After about four to six hours, the exposure rate of the patient has fallen to less than 25 microsieverts per hour at one metre and the patients can be discharged from hospital.

          &lt;li&gt;For unshielded or lightly shielded sources, a NaI detector will not be able to distinguish Ra-224 with its decay products from Pb-212 with its decay products.  However, an HPGe detector can allow you to resolve both the 238.6 keV Pb-212 peak (43.3% yield) and the 241.0 keV Ra-224 peak (4.1% yield).&lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;li&gt;Lastly, the gamma signature for Ra-224 and Pb-212 will look like U-232/Th-228 since no strong gamma signatures occur in the U-232/Th-228 decay chain prior to Ra-224.

However, an HPGe detector can allow you to resolve both the 238.6 keV Pb-212 peak (43.3% yield) and the 241.0 keV Ra-224 peak (4.1% yield).&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;For a well shielded source (shielding the 238.6 keV and 241.0 keV peaks), neither a NaI or HPGe detector will be able to distinguish Ra-224 with its decay products from Pb-212 with its decay products.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Lastly, the gamma signature for Ra-224 and Pb-212 will look like U-232/Th-228 since no strong gamma signatures occur in the U-232/Th-228 decay chain prior to Ra-224.  This is especially true for low resolution spectrometers where you can’t resolve both the 238.6 keV Pb-212 and the 241.0 keV Ra-224 peaks.&lt;/li&gt;

 Average neutron energy = 5 MeV.  Yield = 1.7E+07 n/s per Ci.  Per ICRU26 (1977).

U-Ore and Ra-226 decay chain gamma spectra are similar.  

U-Ore versus Ra-226: U-Ore spectra may contain detectable U x-rays (98.4 and 94.6 keV), U-238 decay product emissions (92.6, 63.3, 1001.0 keV), or U-235 emissions (143.8, 163.3, 205.3 keV) that are not present in Ra-226 decay chain spectra.

Ra-226 can be detectable at a higher activity than its decay products (Pb-214/Bi-214) due to diffusion/escape of the noble gas radon (Rn-222).

Liquefied petroleum gas: The radioactive noble gas, Rn-222 (half-life = 3.8 days), is commonly concentrated during the production and storage of liquefied petroleum gas.  Accordingly, Rn-222 decay products (effective half-life is approximately 30 minutes) can be readily detected via gamma spectroscopy during storage and transport.
